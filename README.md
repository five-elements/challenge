The Five Elements Challenge
===========================
The five elements are five essential and fundamental game archetypes that have 
each changed video game history. As a hobbyist game programmer I think every 
game coder's right of passage should be implementing each archetype in order 
to conquer that game's specific problem domain. It's a little bit like Luke 
Skywalker's jedi training culminating in the creation of his own light saber. 
By the end of the challenge the programmer will have accumulated a body of 
knowledge and code to weild as a weapon in the face of mental confrontation.

The Elements
============
Each element is a building block in the quest for game code mastery. Here they
are listed in (expected) order of increasing difficulty.
