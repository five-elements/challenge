The Five Elements Challenge
===========================
The five elements are five essential and fundamental game archetypes that have 
each changed video game history. As a hobbyist game programmer I think a
worth while right of passage is to implement each archetype in order to conquer 
a specific problem domain. It's a little bit like Luke Skywalker's Jedi training 
culminating in the creation of his own light saber. By the end of the five 
challenges the programmer will have accumulated a body of knowledge and code to 
weild as a weapon in the face of mental confrontation.

The Elements
============
Each element is a building block in the quest for game code mastery. Here they
are listed in (expected) order of increasing difficulty.

    My notes are listed like this and won't be present in the final
    version.

The Text Adventure
------------------
    I'm pretty sure this should be first as it takes the least amount of
    graphics knowledge. Programmers of most langs will be able to finish
    this challenge without external libs, etc.

The Roguelike
-------------
    This is a good transition from the text adventure as it can be rendered
    in text or graphically. If the student decides to move on to grapical
    rendering then the gameplay can be turn based or continuous. 

The Arcade Classic 
------------------
    Pong, Breakout, etc. Pong seems like the simplest game that includes
    input, time, and graphics rendering. 

The Platformer
--------------
    Definitely an element and somewhat complex at that.

The First Person Shooter
------------------------
    The most complicated element and the current state of the art game 
    genre.

How to Participate
==================
If you'd like to participate in The Five Elements Challenge just fork this repo 
to your github and start hacking. There's no prizes, deadlines, authorities or 
rockstars. There are only students, a feeling of accomplishment and the 
comaraderie of those other fellows of the five elements :)

Notes
-----
I've included some files for pre and post mortems for each element. Feel free 
to add your thoughts on what went wrong or right along the way. Most of all
have fun learning!

Here would be a good place to do a pull request with links to high quality 
articles on game programming in general. The more language and paradigm 
agnostic the better!
