The Five Elements Challenge
===========================
The five elements are five essential and fundamental game archetypes that have 
each changed video game history. As a hobbyist game programmer I think every 
game coder's right of passage should be implementing each archetype in order 
to conquer that game's specific problem domain. It's a little bit like Luke 
Skywalker's jedi training culminating in the creation of his own light saber. 
By the end of the challenge the programmer will have accumulated a body of 
knowledge and code to weild as a weapon in the face of mental confrontation.

The Elements
============
Each element is a building block in the quest for game code mastery. Here they
are listed in (expected) order of increasing difficulty.

The Text Adventure
------------------
    I'm pretty sure this should be first as it takes the least amount of
    graphics knowledge. Most coders of most langs will be able to finish
    this challenge without external libs, etc.

The Ball and Paddle
-------------------
    Pong, Breakout, etc. Pong seems like the simplest game that includes
    input, time, and graphics rendering. If the simulation challenge
    doesn't hold (I'm thinking Roguelike may be a better fit) then it's
    possible Roguelike should go second, as it can be solved with or 
    without graphics.

The Simulation
--------------
    This challenge is on the fence for me. I like the idea of conway's
    game of life being in the challenge but I'm not sure if it's 
    archetypal of games. Simulations aren't really games until they're
    game-ified, if you will. I'm thinking of replacing this with Roguelike. 

The Platformer
--------------
    Definitely an element and somewhat complex at that.

The First Person Shooter
------------------------
    The most complicated element and the current state of the art game 
    genre.

How to Participate
==================
If you'd like to participate in The Five Elements Challenge just fork this repo 
to your github and start hacking. There's no prizes, deadlines, authorities or 
rockstars. There are only students, a feeling of accomplishment and the 
comaraderie of those other fellows of the five elements :)

Notes
-----
I've included some files for pre and post mortems for each element. Feel free 
to add your thoughts on what went wrong or right along the way. Most of all
have fun learning!

Here would be a good place to do a pull request with links to high quality 
articles on game programming in general. The more language and paradigm 
agnostic the better!
